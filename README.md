A C and OpenGL Planetary Gravity Simulation.
This project was made as part of a university unit, introduction to graphics programming. 
We were to use C and OpenGL to create a simulation of some description.
This was my first encounter with OpenGL.

Most things are as they were when I submitted. The only changes are:
  - Added mouse scrollwheel zoom.
  - Used a library for image loading instead of the hand-coded RAW loader. (http://nothings.org/stb_image.c)
  - Swapped out the planet textures for quick photoshop jobs (I'm no picasso!). 
  The original planet maps used when I submitted the project were freely-available textures which 
  were sourced from various astronomy websites - however I thought I'd avoid any fuss of redistributing 
  other people's work by just whipping up my own dodgy textures.
  - JPG instead of RAW texture formats used to save on space (plus no faffing around with image sizes).
 
  
Thanks and enjoy! :)
